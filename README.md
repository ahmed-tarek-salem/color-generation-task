# Color Generation App
This is a simple application that displays the text "Hello there" in the middle of the screen and changes the background color to a randomly generated color when the user taps anywhere on the screen. The text has some shadows to make it visually apparent always.

## Installation 
To install the app, simply download the APK file from this link:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tetw0FTUo9Lwqot7QcmIcbeKB5LgsbvG/view?usp=share_link
and install it on your Android device.

## Usage
To use the app, simply open it on your Android device. You should see the text "Hello there" displayed in the middle of the screen. Tap anywhere on the screen to change the background color to a randomly generated color.

## State management
As this application is simple, I don't use state management here. However, the code is performant using const constructors and stateful builders to decrease rebuilds and boost performance.

## Bonus
Smooth color fading when tapping the screen, in addition to unit tests
